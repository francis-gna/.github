## Hello world 👋

We are *the Francis GNA Project*. We are trying to develop the left over concept of simulated consciousness (SC). It literally means that we are building a computer simulation of human mind.

We hope that with time, intelligence will emerge from our imitation of human mental processes, and that such an intelligence will be a lighter, yet more powerful alternative to AI.
Our ambitious project is based on a concept that we imagined: *“graph-based natural analysis"* or *“GNA”*. It’s a way for computers to store and process abstract hierarchies of data. We will say more about it in the next months.

Our implementation of the GNA pattern is called *“Francis"*. It is an artificial or simulated person. We train him through a process called *“natural learning"*. Unlike machine learning, natural learning doesn’t consist of showing millions of examples of a certain concept to the model until it figures out their common pattern. It rather consists of “explaining" step by step, the relationships between the items of a certain category, until the model can use those relationships to identify the right items.

We plan to make our results public on July 1st 2023, by letting everybody download freely our model and test it on their personal computer. You will be amazed by the smallness of the size of the package. From then on, we will regularly publish updates of the program.

Finally, we will publish a paper that will expose fully the details of GNA and those of our own implementation of it (Francis), which source code will be open sourced. We hope that this important step will be completed before March 1st 2024.
